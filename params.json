{"name":"Student's Assistant","tagline":"Never forget about school class again.","body":"[Get it on Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/cs-cz/store/apps/students-assistent/9nblggh5x9wd)\r\n### Why should I use it?\r\nThe app should make it easier for you to manage all the school stuff.\r\n\r\n### Why not just use calendar?\r\nI used calendar for several years myself, but there were some issues with it. It took a lot of work to write all classes in it and it would take ever more work to make each class as seperate event. You can also add teachers information to each class Instance\r\n\r\n### What can it do?\r\n* Keep track of your classes and homeworks (Tasks)\r\n* Save several informations about your teachers\r\n* Notifications for tasks\r\n* Live-tiles (Shows upcoming task(preffered) or class)\r\n* Export to json and ical (Open calendar format supported by majority of calendars) formats\r\n* Import from json\r\n* Sync across Windows 10 devices (May take a minute or two)\r\n* You're still reading? just give it a try. \r\n\r\n### What's next?\r\nIf you submit a feedback on github or microsoft store review, I'll review it and decide whether it should be added or not. If you can code yourself, you can add certain features by yourself and than submit them to the main app. Remember that you're not allowed to publish those updates at Microsoft Store!\r\n","google":"UA-67912885-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
