{"name":"Student's Assistant","tagline":"Never forget about school class again.","body":"[Get it on Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/cs-cz/store/apps/students-assistent/9nblggh5x9wd)\r\n### Why should I use it?\r\nThe app should make it easier for you to manage all the school stuff.\r\n\r\n### Why not just use calendar?\r\nI used calendar for several years myself, but there were some issues with it. It took a lot of work to write all classes in it and it would take ever more work to make each class as seperate event. You can also add teachers information to each class Instance\r\n\r\n### What can it do?\r\n* Keep track of your classes and homeworks (Tasks)\r\n* Save several informations about your teachers\r\n* Notifications for tasks\r\n* Live-tiles (Shows upcoming task(preffered) or class)\r\n* Export to json and ical (Open calendar format supported by majority of calendars) formats\r\n* Import from json\r\n* Sync across Windows 10 devices (May take a minute or two)\r\n* You're still reading? just give it a try. \r\n\r\n### Thats cool, but what about mobile?\r\nWell, that is a tricky question. The app itself is tested only on desktop and shouldn't even be avaiable on win 10 phones because of that and Android app is part of the project, but it is far from finished. The problem is that I would prefer to implement onedrive (because you need MS account anyway to download the app from the store) as storage for this sharing and it doesn't have currently API for Android (and even Windows 10 (Universal apps)) yet. If it isn't out by the end of the year, I'll just use the REST API for onedrive, but I prefer platform specific API, because it takes less time to implement and even might be better handled than I would do it. If you want, you can finish the app for me with REST, but I don't think thats necessary. I have implemented export for iCal which is kind of a mobile app placeholder for now.\r\n\r\n### What's next?\r\nIf you submit a feedback on github or microsoft store review, I'll review it and decide whether it should be added or not. If you can code yourself, you can add certain features by yourself and than submit them to the main app. Remember that you're not allowed to publish those updates at Microsoft Store!\r\n\r\nI had some ideas like adding file support for classes, where you would attach your notes to the class and it would sync to onderive and would be accessible from the mobile app, but as I wrote in the about mobile section, I want to wait for proper universal a android onedrive api.\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-67912885-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
